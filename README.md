# FaceDetector

FaceDetector is an Android application designed to detect and tag faces in images stored in a local gallery. This project demonstrates the use of advanced Android development practices, integrating Room for local database management, Glide for image loading, and a custom implementation of face detection.

## Features
- **Face Detection:** Automatically detects faces in images from a local gallery.
- **Face Tagging:** Allows users to tag detected faces with specific identifiers.
- **Responsive UI:** A clean, intuitive interface optimized for all screen sizes.
- **Room Database Integration:** Efficiently stores and retrieves face tags with Room persistence library.
- **Glide Image Loading:** Smooth and efficient image loading using Glide.
- - **Search by Tag:** Retrieve images based on face and tag identifiers (coming soon).

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language:** Kotlin
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **Database:** Room
- **Image Loading:** Glide
- **Testing Frameworks:** JUnit

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio (latest version recommended)
- Minimum SDK version: 24
- Gradle version: 8.1.1

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sandeep27d/FaceDetector.git

Open the project in Android Studio.
Sync the project with Gradle files.
Build and run the project on an emulator or physical device.

Key Components
Database

    AppDatabase: Central database class with a DAO for face tagging.
    FaceTagDao: DAO interface providing methods to query and manipulate face tags.

ViewModel

    MainActivityViewModel: Handles UI-related data, including querying face tags and managing states.

Repository

    FaceTagRepository: Abstracts the data layer, providing a clean API for ViewModels to interact with the Room database.

Tests

  Unit Tests: Written using JUnit and MockK to test repository and DAO methods.
  Instrumentation Tests: Written using Espresso to validate UI interactions.

Glide Integration

Images are efficiently loaded into the UI using Glide:

    Glide.with(context)
        .load(imagePath)
        .placeholder(R.drawable.placeholder)
        .into(imageView)

Development Practices

  Modern Android Development (MAD): Includes Jetpack components like ViewModel, Room, and LiveData.
  Clean Architecture: Separation of concerns using MVVM pattern.
